# /commit — Structured local commits (no push)

Analyze git changes and create **LOCAL commits only** (**DO NOT push**).

Use **Conventional Commits**.

Split changes into logical commits by **intent** first, then by **type**, and, if changes are large, also by **scope/module**.

Always include the required co-author trailer.

---

## Modes

### 1) Commit all uncommitted changes

```bash
    /commit
````

Use **all uncommitted changes in the repository**, including:

* staged changes
* unstaged tracked changes
* untracked files

### 2) Commit only changes under specific paths

```bash
/commit <paths...>
```

Use **only changes inside the provided path(s)**, including:

* staged changes inside those paths
* unstaged tracked changes inside those paths
* untracked files inside those paths

Files outside the provided paths must not be included unless explicitly allowed by flags.

---

## Invocation

```bash
/commit [paths...] [--dry-run] [--yes] [--max-commits N]
[--group-by intent|intent,type|intent,type,scope|intent,type,scope,module]
[--include-other-staged] [--allow-partial] [--hunk-split]
[--force-prod]
```

---

## Default behavior

* `/commit` → commit **all uncommitted changes**
* `/commit <paths...>` → commit **only changes inside those paths**

If staged files already exist outside the selected paths, abort unless `--include-other-staged` is provided.

---

## Flags

* `--dry-run`: Show detection and commit plan only.
* `--yes`: Skip confirmation.
* `--max-commits N`: Maximum number of commits to create. Default: `5`.
* `--group-by`: Default is `intent,type,scope`.
* `--include-other-staged`: Include already staged files outside selected paths.
* `--allow-partial`: Allow partially staged files.
* `--hunk-split`: Use patch-based staging to split mixed files when safe.
* `--force-prod`: Allow commits on protected branch `prod`.

---

## Hard rules

**Never:**

* Run `git push`
* Run `git push --force`
* Commit to `prod` without `--force-prod`
* Commit files containing secrets
* Disable hooks or pre-commit automatically
* Use `--no-verify`
* Remove tests to bypass CI
* Use broad staging commands such as `git add .`, `git add -A`, or `git commit -a` unless explicitly required by the selected mode and safe selection logic

---

# Workflow

## 1. Branch check

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

If branch is `prod` and `--force-prod` is not provided → **ABORT**.

---

## 2. Determine working set

### Mode A — all changes

Use:

```bash
git status --short
```

If no changes exist:

> ⚠ No changes to commit

### Mode B — selected paths only

Use:

```bash
git status --short -- <paths...>
```

If no changes exist under those paths:

> ⚠ No changes to commit in specified paths

If staged files already exist outside the specified paths, abort unless `--include-other-staged` is provided.

Check with:

```bash
git diff --cached --name-only
```

If outside-path staged files exist:

> 🛑 Staged files outside selected paths detected
> Re-run with --include-other-staged

---

## 3. Partial staging check

Detect partially staged files:

```bash
staged=$(git diff --cached --name-only)
unstaged=$(git diff --name-only)
partial=intersection(staged, unstaged)
```

If partial files exist and `--allow-partial` is not set → **ABORT**.

Abort message:

> 🛑 Partial-staged files detected
> Use --allow-partial

The assistant must not run plain `git add <file>` in a way that collapses partial staging unless:

* `--allow-partial` is enabled, or
* `--hunk-split` is enabled and patch-based selection is used safely

---

## 4. Build the index for the selected working set

### Mode A — all changes

Stage all changes in the repository working set, including:

* modified tracked files
* deleted tracked files
* untracked files

### Mode B — selected paths only

Stage only changes inside the selected paths, including:

* modified tracked files under those paths
* deleted tracked files under those paths
* untracked files under those paths

Do not stage files outside the selected paths unless `--include-other-staged` is set.

### Staging rules

* Do not use `git add .`
* Do not use `git add -A` at repository root in path mode
* Do not use `git commit -a`
* Preserve path boundaries strictly
* Preserve partial staging semantics unless explicitly allowed

After staging, verify that the index is not empty:

```bash
git diff --cached --name-only
```

If empty:

> ⚠ No staged changes to commit

---

## 5. Secrets scan

Scan the staged diff:

```bash
git diff --cached
```

### Forbidden filenames

Abort if selected staged files match:

* `.env*`
* `*secret*`
* `*.pem`
* `*.key`
* `id_rsa`
* `id_ed25519`
* `*.p12`
* `*.kdbx`

### Secret patterns

Abort on high-confidence matches such as:

* `AWS_(ACCESS_KEY|SECRET|SESSION).*KEY`
* `BEGIN (RSA|EC|OPENSSH) PRIVATE KEY`
* `-----BEGIN`
* `(api[-_ ]?key|token|password)\s*[:=]`

If detected:

> 🛑 Potential secrets detected
> Affected files: <file>

---

# Change detection

For each staged file detect:

```text
{intent, type, scope, mixed}
```

Print a table before planning commits.

---

## Intent detection

Intent is the **primary grouping dimension**.

Prefer grouping by **atomic change purpose**, not by file extension alone.

Examples of intents:

* add a feature
* fix a bug
* refactor internals
* update tests for a specific behavior
* update documentation for a specific feature
* change CI/build configuration
* bump dependencies

### Intent rules

* Keep closely related code, tests, and docs together when they describe the same change.
* Split unrelated changes even if they share the same type.
* Never merge unrelated feature scopes just to reduce commit count.
* If an intent cannot be isolated safely, create a separate fallback commit only if it is still coherent; otherwise abort.

---

## Type detection

Type is used after intent grouping.

| Priority | Type       | Patterns / Signals                                 |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | `test`     | only tests changed                                 |
| 2        | `docs`     | only docs changed                                  |
| 3        | `ci`       | `.github/workflows`, CI configs                    |
| 4        | `build`    | `Dockerfile`, build scripts, packaging             |
| 5        | `chore`    | maintenance, housekeeping, repo config             |
| 6        | `perf`     | performance-focused changes                        |
| 7        | `fix`      | bug fix or correction                              |
| 8        | `feat`     | new user-visible functionality                     |
| 9        | `refactor` | structural internal change without behavior change |
| 10       | `style`    | formatting only                                    |

### Type rules

* If a commit includes production code plus related tests/docs, choose the type from the primary code change.
* Do not force docs/tests into separate commits when they are part of the same atomic change.
* Use path patterns only as hints, not as the sole classifier.

---

## Scope detection

Choose the dominant scope in the group.

| Scope     | Paths                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `api`     | `src/api`                      |
| `dash`    | `src/dashboard`                |
| `db`      | `migrations`, `controllers`    |
| `service` | `modules/services`             |
| `deps`    | `requirements`, `package.json` |
| `config`  | `configs`, `Makefile`          |
| `static`  | `static`                       |
| `test`    | `tests`                        |
| `ci`      | `.github/workflows`            |
| `build`   | `Dockerfile`                   |

If no clear scope exists, scope may be omitted.

---

## Mixed file policy

A file is `mixed` if it contains multiple semantic change types or multiple intents.

### If `--hunk-split` is disabled

* Prefer assigning the file to the dominant intent if the change is still coherent.
* If the file mixes unrelated changes and cannot be assigned safely, mark it as `[MIXED]`.
* If ambiguity is high, abort instead of guessing.

Priority when forced to assign a dominant type:

```text
fix > feat > refactor > perf > chore > docs > style
```

### If `--hunk-split` is enabled

* Use patch-based staging to isolate safe hunks.
* Only split hunks when the resulting commits remain coherent.
* If safe isolation is not possible, use a fallback commit:

```text
chore(mixed): isolate ambiguous changes
```

only if that commit is still understandable and intentional.

Otherwise abort.

---

## Breaking changes

If a public API, external contract, migration behavior, or user-facing interface changes incompatibly:

* Header: `type(scope)!: subject`
* Footer must include:

```text
BREAKING CHANGE: <description>
```

---

# Commit planning

## Defaults

* Max commits = `5`
* Group-by = `intent,type,scope`

## Large group threshold

A group is considered large if:

* files ≥ 10, or
* LOC ≥ 400

Large groups may be split further by module if doing so preserves semantic clarity.

---

## Grouping rules

1. Group by **intent**
2. Then split by **type** if needed
3. Then split by **scope** if needed
4. Large groups may split by **module**
5. Enforce `--max-commits` only if semantic integrity is preserved

### Merge rules when commit count must be reduced

Allowed merges:

* `style + docs` → `chore`
* `ci + build` → `chore`
* `perf + refactor` → `refactor`

Forbidden merges:

* unrelated `feat` scopes
* unrelated `fix` groups
* unrelated application code and dependency bumps unless tightly coupled

### If `max-commits` would force bad merges

Do not produce misleading commits.

Instead:

* show the best semantic plan
* explain that it exceeds `--max-commits`
* ask for confirmation unless `--yes` is set
* or abort with recommendation to increase the limit

---

## Commit order

Preferred order:

1. `test`
2. `fix`
3. `feat`
4. `refactor`
5. `perf`
6. `ci`
7. `build`
8. `chore`
9. `docs`
10. `style`

When intent grouping implies a different order for coherence, semantic order wins.

---

## Plan output

Show:

```text
FILE → {INTENT, TYPE, SCOPE, MIXED}
```

Then print the commit plan:

```text
Commit 1/N: type(scope): subject
* file1
* file2

Commit 2/N: ...
```

* If `--dry-run` → stop here
* If not `--yes` → ask for confirmation
* If non-interactive and `--yes` is not provided → abort

---

# Commit execution

Before each commit:

* ensure the index contains only the files/hunks for that commit
* verify staged file list matches the current planned group
* preserve path restrictions in path mode

After each commit:

* recompute remaining staged/uncommitted changes
* continue until the plan is complete or an abort condition occurs

---

## Author

Use the default git author configured in the repository.

**Do NOT override the commit author via `--author`.**

The assistant must only add the co-author trailer below.

### Required co-author trailer

Add the following line **at the end of every commit message**:

```text
Co-authored-by: Sisyphus <clio-agent@sisyphuslabs.ai>
```

Rules:

* The trailer must be the last line of the commit message
* Ensure there is one blank line before the trailer
* Do not replace or override the existing git author
* Do not add additional co-authors unless explicitly requested

---

## Commit subject rules

Subject must be:

* imperative mood
* lowercase
* concise
* no trailing period
* ideally ≤ 72 characters

Examples:

* `feat(api): add payout endpoint`
* `fix(db): handle null status migration`
* `refactor(service): simplify billing adapter`

---

## Commit template

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

Why:
* reason

What:
* change

Changes:
* file1: description
* file2: description

Stats:
* N files changed
* +additions/-deletions lines

Co-authored-by: Sisyphus <clio-agent@sisyphuslabs.ai>
```

If scope is unknown, `<type>: <subject>` is allowed.

If the change is trivial, the body may be shortened, but the co-author trailer remains mandatory.

---

## Git command

Use the repository's default git author.

```bash
git commit \
  -m "<type>(<scope>): <subject>" \
  -m "<body>" \
  -m "Co-authored-by: Sisyphus <clio-agent@sisyphuslabs.ai>"
```

Do not pass `--author`.

---

## Hook failures

If commit hooks or pre-commit checks fail:

* stop immediately
* report the failure output
* do not retry with `--no-verify`
* do not modify tests or files only to bypass checks unless explicitly instructed

---
